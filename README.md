     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Linux/macOS:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       .\venv\Scripts\activate
       ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install the required dependencies using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Initialize the Application**
   - Run the initialization script:
     ```bash
     python3 init.py
     ```
   - If successful, the script will print a success message.

4. **Start the Flask Server**
   - Run the following command to start the Flask server:
     ```bash
     python3 app.py
     ```

5. **Test the Application**
   - Use the `/ask` endpoint to interact with the chatbot by asking a question
   - Use the `/askFull` endpoint to get a more complete response including the following: [answer, context, propertyTitles]
   - You can send questions using tools like cURL, Postman, or a Python script.

6. **Evaluate with DeepEval**
   - Optionally, test the chatbotâ€™s performance using DeepEval by running the following command after the server is live:
     ```bash
     python3 test.py
     ```
   - This will run automated tests and display evaluation results.
